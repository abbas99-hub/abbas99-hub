Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm an AI Developer with around 2 years of experience specializing in HR Analytics. I enjoy working on projects that leverage machine learning and data analysis techniques to provide valuable insights into the HR domain.

## üî≠ What I'm Working On

- I'm developing a more advanced version of the Resume Summarization System using natural language processing (NLP) to automatically extract key information from resumes and generate concise summaries.
- Also, I'm building an integrated dynamic HR Analytics Dashboard to visualize and analyze key HR metrics, such as employee attrition, performance, and diversity.

## üå± What I'm Learning

- I'm expanding my NLP knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs) like BERT, and GPT-3 and exploring advanced NLP architectures like Hugging Face Transformer and many more to enhance the accuracy and quality of my HR-related projects.
- I'm also diving deeper into recommendation systems, exploring different algorithms and strategies to improve the precision and personalization of job recommendations.
